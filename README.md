# BBMatrix54

BBMatrix54 is a small LED matrix controlled by an Arduino Nano processor board. The LED matrix consists of LED arranged in a 5x4 matrix, and there are also two input buttons. This device can be programmed using the Arduino IDE. This GitHub repository contains the BBMatrixLib library that can be used for programming this device, and there are also several coding exercises.

Instructions for building the BBMatrix54 circuit are available here: [BBMatrix54 Build Instructions](http://bit.ly/2JhGEmI). The BBMatrix54 circuit is based on an earlier project [BBGame114](https://github.com/mtejada11/BBGame114).

# BBMatrix54 Arduino Library

The [BBMatrix54Lib.zip](https://github.com/mtejada11/BBMatrix54/blob/master/Lib/BBMatrix54Lib.zip?raw=true) library for Arduino included in this repository is a library that allows the BBMatrix54 device to be programmed with higher level methods/functions than the Arduino `digitalWrite` and `digitalRead` functions. See the page [BBMatrix54Lib Library Reference](https://github.com/mtejada11/BBMatrix54/wiki/BBMatrix54Lib-Library-Reference) page for more information on this library.
